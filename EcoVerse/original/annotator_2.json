    "Text": "Geologist, Dr. Ian Plimer, explains how climate catastrophists ignore almost the entirety of Earth's climate history, in order to prop up the fictitious human-induced \"climate crisis\" narrative:\"We are living in times that are not unusual. Since humans have been on the earth, we've had thousands of climate changes... [But] the agenda is to show that any change on Earth is due to human sin, due to human activity—it's not due to natural processes.\"\"And this is why the past gets cancelled—why history, archaeology and geology gets cancelled—because it's extraordinarily inconvenient, and the past tells us that the planet is very healthy, we have normal cycles, there's nothing to worry about. The only crisis we've got is a crisis of propaganda and a crisis of people's knowledge.\"Full interview: [URL] more content like this, visit: [URL]#ClimateScam #ClimateCult #NetZero #NetZeroScam",
